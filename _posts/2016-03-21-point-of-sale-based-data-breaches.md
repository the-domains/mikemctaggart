E-Commerce - Is it safer than retail?

_Image credit:_[Nate Grigg on Flickr][0]

Just a day after Dairy Queen's announcement on Thursday October 9th that nearly 400 stores had been breached (here's a list of the[hacked Dairy Queen locations][1]), Kmart became the most recent retailer to announce a[malware-based breach][2]of its point of sale systems. With the news following announcements from Target, Home Depot, and JP Morgan Chase - each announcing some of the largest data breaches in history - one has to ponder, "am I safer shopping online than I am in the stores?"

Let's take a closer look at the nature of some of these cyber attacks.

Point-of-Sale based data breaches

The largest recent breaches have involved Target and Home Depot. While there is

some debate

on whether both retail security breaches were executed by the same group of hackers, there is no doubt that the same technique was used in both cases. In fact, there's no debate that the attacks even used the same basic source code. What most people probably don't realize is that this code has been

available since 2012

- oh, and it's the product of a Russian teenager. The malware has been dubbed BlackPOS and works by grabbing data from infected point-of-sale (POS) machines running (whether you realize it or not) MS Windows.

"Like those self-checkout machines at the grocery store? - Gasp!" Yup, those - but standing in line for a cashier may not help you either. You'll notice those machines aren't old-school cash registers anymore - they're web-connected multi-display units that not only capture payment data, but also offer product recommendations, discounts on future purchases, and more.

The widespread proliferation of web-connected POS machines has led to a realization by hackers that they're easy prey. While Target and Home Depot made big headlines due to the amount of data lost, there have also been major announcements in the last 60 days from Jimmy John's (the "freaky fast" sandwich shop) that tied the breach back to a

3rd party POS vendor

that also services a ton of mom-and-pop retailers, and Goodwill Stores - another

3rd party payment system breach

that lasted

18 months

. Stolen data ranges from complete identities (names plus personal info such as addresses) to "only" payment card info (that would still allow unscrupulous individuals to "clone" the credit cards themselves).

And even if the POS machine itself isn't compromised and streaming your information out to foreign servers, low-tech "skimmers" have gotten

increasingly advanced

. Imagine a razor thin device that fits

inside

the card slot at your ATM or at the checkout - as you swipe your card, the criminals make a copy of the information without your knowledge. A hidden camera (or keypad overlay) captures your PIN as you enter it and voila - you've unwittingly funded their next shopping spree.

# 

So, nervous about swiping that card at the checkout now?

If you're like me, you see how this is a complete reversal of the prevailing behavior and perception across the country. For a time, much of the public was wary of keying credit card numbers into a mysterious and faceless website. That very concern has driven

e-commerce developers

like Atlantic BT to become very focused on securing identity and payment data through all parts of the shopping experience. On many e-commerce websites, the payment card data never even passes through their servers - it is encrypted, sent securely to an online payment processor (such as Authorize.net), and only the "success or rejected" data is sent back to the e-commerce site. Even in cases where recurring payments occur, the payment information is not saved, but instead a unique "token" that connects the customer's payment info to specific merchant is utilized. In other words, even if a database of tokens is stolen, the hackers wouldn't be able to do anything with it.

# 

What do you think?

It's no secret that e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales is on the rise - in-store

retail growth for the 2014 holiday season

is forecasted at 4.1% while e-commerce growth is forecasted anywhere from 8-11%. I'm certainly among that percentage of shoppers that has abandoned the crowded shopping malls for the comfort of my living room, tablet or smartphone in hand - but avoiding the crowds is no longer my primary reason for going online.
